Server Password is a server-wide authentication plugin that protects access to your Minecraft server using a secure, fully GUI-based password system.

Instead of typing passwords in chat, players authenticate through a custom interactive code interface, ensuring a clean, safe, and modern login experience — even on offline-mode servers.
